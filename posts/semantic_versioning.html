                        <p>I don&#39;t always play video games, but when I do, I like to try indie games and open source games. I have gotten into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Play_%28video_gaming%29" target="_blank">Let&#39;s Play</a> phenomenon on youtube and, after some bad starts (video and audio encoding woes, and a lot of forced education about video and audio in general) with the good old game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlords_%28game_series%29" target="_blank">Warlords</a>, I aimed to do a Let&#39;s Play of an open source video game. Open source projects can always use free publicity.</p>
<p>The open source game that I first chose, and was going to record, will remain nameless in this article. It has a very high version number, higher than most any game (or even regular software) that I&#39;m aware of. After reading a lot about it, and having played an earlier, incomplete version of the game, I was stoked to try this game again in anticipation of making a walkthrough for it. Despite my best intentions, I couldn&#39;t plow through the most recent version. Short summary: it didn&#39;t feel like I was playing a a game, it felt like attending a tedious and terrible piano recital that never ended. Then again, if the game had pianos in it, that would have been a plus. I deleted the game from my system; there will be no Let&#39;s Play of it.</p>
<p>There is no harm in this entire experience: I got to play a video game for free, which is totally cool. There is still a lot of potential in the game, and I look forward to a future release (assuming they don&#39;t take the last remaining bit of fun in the game and stomp on it). And, on the plus side, playing this nameless game made me think about the difficulties of versioning software.</p>
<p>I have my own preconcieved notions about versions. The coveted software Version 1 means to me something that works for not just me, but for other people, too. Version 2 and greater conveys to me maturity that can only happen once the product is solid and has been beaten on by an audience for awhile. Anything beyond Version 2 seems unnecessary to me, except for convincing a new or wider audience to buy something (which, without business in the picture, is technologicially unnecessary), or to keep up with changing technology (which is sometimes necessary). Example: I&#39;ve enjoyed that after all these years the Linux Kernel is still a low number (most of my boxes/VMs that run some Linux distro use version 2.6.x of the kernel).</p>
<p>Versioning is hard to do right. It&#39;s just as easy to undershoot as it is to grab for a larger version number (bigger is better) in the hopes of convincing the public our software is more special than it might be.</p>
<p>I think one answer to the version problem is proposed at the <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> site. Put simply, it doesn&#39;t say what the numbers mean, but it does attempt to define what deltas in version numbers mean (assuming there is more than one release of a software package). In making the deltas mean something, we have to take a hard look at the software we write. While the article is very gentle, I think the Semantic Versioning proposal could be summed up as, &quot;Use the thing we call common sense that, unfortunately, isn&#39;t very common.&quot;</p>
<p>What does software versioning mean to you? Yeah, I know, someday I&#39;ll turn comments back on, until then, enjoy a nice conversation with yourself about this topic, or with your cube mate, or maybe your significant other before bed time.</p>
