                        <p>I decided to mess around with making video games in JavaScript. I have no real time to do so, but video games make me happy. Plus it&#39;s a good chance to use myself as a lab rat for self-imposed timeboxing and agile and all those other words that the cool kids are using these days to increasne effectiveness.</p>
<p>I picked up a game engine that I have previously used called <a href="http://jsgamesoup.net" target="_blank">jsGameSoup</a> because I am familiar with it. It&#39;s small, light weight, modular, and has an interface approach that I like. A small bit of time into this experiment, I became aware of my pattern of psychology when working on any project. Here I&#39;m going to write down my observations on how I work through projects flavored with how I&#39;m working through this game. My process of problem solving is not pretty.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2014-01-30: Removed links to old code examples.</strong> Code versions still available at <a href="https://github.com/jeremyosborne/shootdown" target="_blank">the github repo</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of my better accomplishments in life come from well laid plans. <em>However</em>, the majority of my projects, maybe 90% of them, are organic blobs of life birthed from a random idea. This project started with a few spare hours of time due to a cancellation in my schedule and a fancy to make a video game. My well thought out design plan?<ul>
<li>had to be written in JavaScript</li>
<li>had to work in a web browser</li>
<li>had to have explosions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OMG I Can See The Mouse!</strong> The reason I don&#39;t give a shit about unimplemented ideas is because even the simplest and worst of ideas want to stay in the warm womb of our minds. Ideas don&#39;t like reality. I can write code to track a mouse moving around the screen in my sleep, but one of the very first things I tried to do, due to how I set up my web page, uncovered a tiny bug in the framework I was using. After swearing a lot, I cracked open the code, fixed the bug, and submitted the fix to the developer. The honeymoon ended fast on this project, which is always a test point for me. Do I still like something after the honeymoon is all over? If yes, press &quot;A&quot; to continue.</li>
<li><strong>Explosions.</strong> I view most projects as entertainment for myself. If they don&#39;t entertain me, I don&#39;t want to do them. Since I decided to continue this project, I needed explosions and I needed them now. A bit of infrared glow against the backdrop of grayscale dreariness gave me the desire to continue.</li>
<li><strong>Targets.</strong> But entertainment really isn&#39;t enough. I need some form of purpose in my projects. If I am going to have explosions, I needed something to run into the explosions and go boom. Evil little triangles flying across the screen would do in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Stopping the Evil Triangles.</strong> As my projects, large or small, begin to mature I am forced to take my initial idea and flesh it out. If I don&#39;t, the project stops because I forget what I&#39;m trying to do and I have difficulty picking up the pieces. I call it project beer goggles: looked like a good idea yesterday, not sure what the hell I was thinking today. If you want to sharpen your math skills, don&#39;t play video games, write them. I really like math, but I use more complex versions of it so little in my day to day life that I make lots of mistakes. What at first looked like the correct equation for detecting collisions between the evil triangles and my explosions had bugs. Multiple bugs. My own bugs. Ugh. Another step of my project accomplished: survive my first fight with my opinions about my (stupid) ideas (wait, it&#39;s fixed, it&#39;s no longer stupid).</li>
<li><strong>Exploding Evil Triangles.</strong> I wish I could say that after 36 years on this planet I have moved beyond the whole credit/debit cycle. I haven&#39;t, and it affects my project management as much as it affects everything else in my life. I really wanted to have a cool effect of the triangles exploding and spraying fragments everywhere, but I was so annoyed at myself for my stupid math mistakes that I wanted instant gratification NAO! I reused my existing explosions and placed the super shrapnel explosions on my TODO list. Gratification achieved.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics and Rating Systems.</strong> I like rating systems and statistics. Almost every project I do has some form of rating system. Example: I have what I call my &quot;Book of Fail&quot; to track my rock climbing failures (the majority) and my successes (the few, the proud moments). This game needed a score. But like with most things, what appears to be really logical after the fact was a random ass throw of the dart. &quot;Let&#39;s see: -1 point for every missile fired, -1 point for every triangle that appears, +5 points for every triangle exploded. Yep, that sounds right.&quot; After a few tests, I empirically deemed the random ass scoring idea acceptable.</li>
<li><strong>!(The Sound of Silence)</strong> The world is changing around web browsers. While I&#39;m pretty much in the &quot;Fuck Interent Explorer 6-8&quot; crowd, I still try to think about the impact of my choices on viewers of my web content. After looking at the audio code included in jsGameSoup, I figured why not add some explosion sound effects? This is always my favorite part of any project: once basic needs are met, see how to make the project better than I expected it to be when I started. I dig the sounds, and I am thankful to the writers of <a href="http://thirdcog.eu/apps/cfxr" target="_blank">cfxr</a>, a small, sound effects creation program that made making the sounds a snap.</li>
<li><strong>Bandages and Duct Tape.</strong> The ending of the honeymoon is the first phase transition of a project for me. Peeling away the bandages and duct tape that holds the beginning successes of a project toether is the second phase transition. On the surface you won&#39;t notice anything different here than in the previous example. Projects need to be maintained, and doing maintenance without screwing up things that already exist and work becomes a real consideration after a project has lived long enough. Here, I addressed for myself an annoyance I have about JavaScript: I don&#39;t want to fix the way JavaScript works, I just want to fix how it looks. I wrote a small function that cleaned up how my code looks without changing how anything works. Beautiful! Maintenance will now be easier (on the eyes).</li>
<li><strong>Take a Moment and Blog.</strong> I took more than a moment to blog about this process, because I also dumped my previous blog engine (that I wrote) and picked up <a href="https://github.com/jeremyosborne/simpleblog" target="_blank">this one</a> (that I also wrote, all bugs are my fault). All of my favorite projects spawn other projects, either due to necessity or plain old fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>The real test of any project is the lifecycle of the project. Will I see this game through to the end? What is the end of this game? I don&#39;t know, but when I figure it out, I&#39;ll tell you.</p>
