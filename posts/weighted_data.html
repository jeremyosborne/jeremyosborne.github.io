                        <p>Sometime in July of 2010, I stood on the scale and the scale told me, in block digital letters, that I weighed 179 lbs. In the grand scheme of things, that&#39;s not such a bad weight. Yet for the months prior to that time I had made all of the changes that I thought I needed to make to keep my weight in the 160s. I was biking to and from work most days a week, and averaging about 10 miles minimum, 7 days a week. I had started doing <a href="http://www.namastebitches.com/" target="_blank">yoga</a> with my wife, and was just beginning to hit the <a href="http://www.planetgranite.com/" target="_blank">climbing gym</a>. And while I didn&#39;t keep a record of it, even with these <em>Good Things<sup>&reg;</sup></em> I was doing, my weight wasn&#39;t going down, it was in fact going up. Not like big arm muscle weight, like bigger belly fat weight.</p>
<p>Being a relentless nerd who is willing to tear things apart to make them better, I decided to take a stab at altering my diet for good. No more fad diets, where fad equaled something I would eventually get tired of. It had to be a diet that did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support an optimal weight for me, whatever the heck that turned out to be.</li>
<li>Let me eat food that I loved to eat.</li>
</ul>
<p>My choice of diet was the <a href="http://paleodiet.com/definition.htm" target="_blank">Paleo Diet</a>. It&#39;s a completely made up diet where the people who made it up assumed that perhaps our minds have advanced, but that our stomachs and digestive systems are not much beyond the paleolithic age.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve talked about this in the past, so I won&#39;t go into details, other than for about a year and a quarter, my diet has consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>meat</li>
<li>cheese</li>
<li>veggies</li>
<li>fruit</li>
</ul>
<p>And for dessert and treat times:</p>
<ul>
<li>french fries</li>
<li>sushi</li>
<li>rice crispy treats</li>
<li>ice cream</li>
<li>wine</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past year and a half, I knew that one way to convince myself of what was working and not was to take a measurement of my weight quite often. I tried to weigh myself at the same time of the day in the same situation. The following chart I think speaks for itself, and my diet adventure, more than any prose could:</p>

<p>Data is sobering to stare at. It doesn&#39;t tell any other truth than what it shows. It can be misconstrued. It can be debated. But with enough of it, it starts to be hard to argue with.</p>
<p>As I&#39;m about to hit the real mid-thirties, it&#39;s nice to feel like I may have found a diet that supports my life from now through my twilight years.</p>
