                        <p>A lot has happened since last Wednesday, which will be a story for another time, a long time in the future, which I&#39;ll probably use to frighten the grandkids.</p>
<p>Since then I&#39;ve been doing a lot of coding. When I don&#39;t code at work, I follow only a few set of rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document everything. Who knows when I&#39;ll get back to it.</li>
<li>Write at least manual tests for everything, automated tests if possible.</li>
<li>Never use tabs, always use spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives me a sandbox to play in, with appropriate boundaries. Inside of this giant playground, I just code and try things out. Most things I do nowadays are strictly JavaScript (and CSS and HTML), and that, too, provides a pretty large playground within a playground.</p>
<p>Like my writing, most of my code is crap, at least for the first 12 iterations. I make lots of mistakes. I test lots of my own theories, most of them bad. And then in the experimentation, I sometimes learn something. Not the usual, &quot;Hey, I read a great blog post, that seems like a great idea.&quot; These moments are more like, &quot;WHOA! That&#39;s what [insert expert here] is actually talking about. That&#39;s COOL!&quot;</p>
<p>This morning, needing to kill some time, I finished up a chunk of code within this blog that you are reading that I&#39;ve been putting off for a week. I started coding last night. After the procrastination, I started work last night. Time spent on actual coding on Sunday === less than one hour. Time spent this morning to get things bug free === about fifteen minutes. Project complete, seemingly bug free after all of my testing and time taking to write documentation.</p>
<p>The reason? I reused code. Not just like a bit of code, a LOT of code. I actually wrote some really good code that has now solved 2 large problems of mine in this blog. This mini project, where I experienced the much coveted reusable code makes me feel that I think I&#39;ve misunderstood the spirit of this idea.</p>
<p>I think we all want our labors to serve more of a purpose than to provide just a single result. But, at least for myself, I have a tendency to try to find the end-all-be-all code that will solve everything, make me money, and make me a sandwich. I waste more time solving problems that don&#39;t actually exist, than solving problems that do. I&#39;m not a psychologist, so I&#39;ll leave out any arm chair psychoanalysis of myself, but as I look forward to all of the hours that I&#39;ll get to spend coding before I end up in great matrix in the sky, I look forward to taking a look at coding problems in a different light.</p>
<p>To me, trying to write reusable code now means: write code that fixes as many problems as possible, or provides as many features as possible, for only the application I&#39;m working on. Don&#39;t worry about the next-application, because when that next-application shows up, I&#39;ll have learned new lessons, and what was once golden code will need to be rewritten.</p>
