                        <p>About a year and a half ago we decided to get chickens. It&#39;s our version of pets, as we like cute animals but we&#39;re not very keen on creatures that do nothing more than eat, sleep, and lick themselves. One of the chickens was the runt of the group, and we named her Lucy. The others were Xena, Lucretia, and Deanna, or rather the evil step sisters. We read a lot of stuff about chickens and learned about pecking orders. The pecking order of a chicken herd makes the Indian caste system sound like equality. We had a bit of worry for Lucy, and thankfully she made it through with flying colors.</p>
<p>Over the months Lucy grew into a fine Buff Orpington. A Buff Orpington is a big, golden, dual purpose (egg laying + meat) bird. Lucy is not as large as our other chickens, but if our stats are right, she lays the most eggs and is by far the most entertaining. All chickens are pretty dumb, but within the range of intelligence that chickens are allowed, Lucy is the Valedictorian and could probably survive a Zombie Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Lucy has grown on me a lot. She tends to wind up in my code examples when I teach. I talk about her in casual conversation. The more I anthropomorphize her, the more her personality moves way beyond the chicken world. I started thinking about what she would act like on the internet?</p>
<p>Creating a personality on the internet is so different today than it was in the 90s. It&#39;s way more like a crowded Actor&#39;s guild full of too many Michael Douglases, with more Michael Douglases lining up every day. I didn&#39;t even look for a plain Lucy name, no Lucy Chicken, no Lucy The Chicken, but Lucy Teh Chicken remained. She has an <a href="mailto:lucytehchicken@gmail.com">email</a>. She is on <a href="https://twitter.com/lucytehchicken" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/lucytehchicken" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and google+ as lucytehchicken. (I&#39;d give the google+ link, but I can&#39;t seem to figure it out.)</p>
<p>Turns out Lucy Teh Chicken is bilingual, but prefers to speak in her native tongue, which is some sort of chicken morse code. I left an old book in the backyard and a spare laptop in the backyard, and she seems to be slowly working through it while honing her computer skills. I&#39;m not sure who she&#39;s communicating with, or even what she&#39;s communicating, but she seems quite determined to get her message out.</p>
<p>As I was helping Lucy get online, the Twitter API was the easiest to figure out, followed by the Facebook API, but google+ doesn&#39;t yet have a working API for her to use. Too bad, because Lucy really likes google+, too.</p>
<p>Only time will tell what Lucy is capable of, and we&#39;ll have to wait and see if she does anything else or just fades away into the flotsam of the talk soup of the internet.</p>
