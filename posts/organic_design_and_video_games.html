                        <p>I love it when experiments take on a life of their own. I had <a href="/posts/javascript_and_videogames.html">previously</a> indulged some video game silliness in a small amount of spare time. I also took the time to document what goes through my mind when I write code, in particular when I code organically, which is what I call &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; but for programmers.</p>
<p>Finding a bit more time to continue the experiment, I&#39;ve put together three more steps of the small game that I&#39;m calling <a href="https://github.com/jeremyosborne/shootdown" target="_blank">shootdown</a>. Below is my documentation of my internal dialog as I move forward, along with a snapshot of the game at each step. <b>EDIT 2014-01-30: Removed links to old code examples.</b> Code versions still available at github repo listed above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nothing looks different from the last time?</strong>  That&#39;s a fair and accurate statement as a player of the game. This is the problem all programmers face from time to time: the code has gotten too [insert some adjective here] and we need to make our lives better before we can go back to adding features that support your life. It&#39;s difficult to convey, although I imagine it&#39;s the same thing that sales people go through when they adamantly argue for the expensing of lap dances that helped to seal the deal. (Aside: I think programmers and sales people are much more alike than anyone wants to give credence to.) One way to make my life better was to add a build process to keep the growing number of files from getting out of hand. This gave me an excuse to experiment with the wonderful <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">grunt</a> build tool that is available to any with <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>. After years spent with Ant and shell scripts, and being nonplussed by both as they never fulfilled my needs as a web nerd, I&#39;m very happy my friend James kept talking about grunt. The grunt club has a very happy and new convert. No matter what excuse I come up with above, at the end, you dear reader are still right: nothing changed from your point of view as game player. I just hope the step back I took to add some things that will make my time more effective, and to ease my psyche as I continue on with this experiment, will result in a game that is one day, fun to play.</li>
<li><strong>Targets to right of them, Targets to left of them, Targets in front of them</strong>, all of them facing the wrong direction. After many of my moments of refactoring, the 9th step made it easier to make bigger pushes in the code, and make more drastic changes. I figured out a few ways to improve the performance of the code, and added in some additional math helpers, which JavaScript as a core language is sorely lacking. I started getting attached to the code in this step and took time to make sure I was using all my tools correctly, namely grunt and git. That&#39;s right, if you want to see previous versions, gotta actually look at the tags or revisions (OMG! tools being used as they&#39;re meant to be used!).</li>
<li><strong>11 steps in, and it&#39;s starting to look like... something.</strong> I know, we&#39;re the engineers. We&#39;re supposed to have everything figured out from the get go. I can&#39;t speak for anyone else, but I rarely have everything figured out, ever. And with the number of product manager type people I&#39;ve worked with, and the number of times I&#39;ve watched people change their mind daily about what the final product should look like, perhaps I&#39;m one of the few who will actually admit I&#39;m lost and confused sometimes? This step was fun, because it let me figure out the scope for the game that I wanted: multiplayer space shoot em up. Without worry for performance, I cleaned things up, added a scrolling background via CSS3 animations, made the targets face their direction of travel, and generally had a great time coding this step. I also realized there is a fair amount of work to do to get to the final product, but it&#39;s good to have a final product in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming really can be fun when a solid foundation is set, and enough time for experimentation and refactoring is allowed. Time for performance improvements and to add multiplayer.</p>
