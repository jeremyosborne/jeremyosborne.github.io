                        <p>I&#39;ve never been very good at being fully honest. Around 2005, after I had a few quarter-life crises, I decided that I&#39;d start down the long path of discovering what it meant to be honest.</p>
<p>A little over 5 years down that path, I think I know less than when I started, but I think I found the punchline of being honest:</p>
<p><strong>Once you start down the honesty path, you have to keep going.</strong></p>
<p>This has been the simplest, yet hardest piece for me to grasp. What does this look like in real life?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Random Person]: How are you doing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You realize they are talking to you, and you&#39;re having a for-the-love-of-god-and-all-that-is-holy-my-anus-is-bleeding shitty day. No immortality for you today, your emotions are fucked up, your hormones racing, it&#39;s like you&#39;ve been donkey punched, and you haven&#39;t had your coffee yet. All of a sudden, though, you realize that you&#39;re at work. So you respond with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[You]: I&#39;m fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>YOU JUST FAILBLOG.COM&#39;D THE HONESTY PATH!</strong> Yep, it&#39;s that simple. Nothing is safe once you start down the honest path. Here&#39;s another test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Random Super-obese Person]: Do these vertical stripes show the 5 lbs. of bacon that I ate this morning?</p>
<p>[If your name is Jeremy, even if you&#39;re at work, and you&#39;re being honest, you have to respond with]: Fuck you for not sharing that bacon!!!!!! It&#39;s been 5 minutes since I had a piece and I can&#39;t believe you for not sharing with me. You&#39;re not my friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honesty, amazingly useful when applied <strong>ALWAYS</strong> but not very useful when applied only sometimes.</p>
