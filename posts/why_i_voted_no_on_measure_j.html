                        <p>Tomorrow Santa Clara, California opens it&#39;s polls for the California June, 2010 Primaries. Santa Clara City, the city I live in, has been pushing, and pushing, and pushing Measure J. There&#39;s some substance to Measure J, but the simple version is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A yes vote on Measure J means we, the citizens, allow the building a stadium near the that the San Francisco 49ers will play their games in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will they become the Santa Clara 49ers? No, that would be pretty stupid. Essentially, my view of this measure, being someone who could give a rats ass about football, is the equivalent of voting for a landfill in Santa Clara that is only used by San Francisco residents.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t really need a reason to vote no, but I found the BEST reason to vote no. I hate marketing material, especially when the people pushing Measure J seem to have clear cut all of wood in the Santa Cruz mountains to make the fliers.</p>
<p>For my astute readers, take a look at the wonderful picture below:</p>

</div>

<p>In case you missed it, let&#39;s zoom in:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremyosborne/4679270390/"><img alt="Measure J - Error" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4679270390_b273922c49.jpg"></a>
</div>

<p>Remember marketing people: Nothing pisses me off more than someone trying to shock and awe me, especially when they think I&#39;ll be shocked and awed by blue screens of death and MS SQL errors.</p>
